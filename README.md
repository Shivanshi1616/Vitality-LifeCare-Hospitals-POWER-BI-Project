## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive and interactive dashboard for Vitality LifeCare Hospitals Analysis. This dashboard visualizes key metrics such as bed occupancy, doctor feedback, diagnosis types, and financial data. It aims to assist healthcare administrators in making data-driven decisions to improve hospital operations and patient care.

Throughout this project, I had the chance to:
- Dive deep into healthcare data to uncover valuable insights.
- Develop interactive dashboards to visualize key healthcare metrics.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for strategic decision-making.

## Dataset Used

The dataset was sourced from an Excel worksheet named "Vitality LifeCare Healthcare Dataset". It contains information about patient IDs, admit dates, discharge dates, diagnoses, bed occupancy, tests, doctors, follow-up dates, feedback, billing amounts, and health insurance amounts.

## Steps Followed

### Data Gathering
- **Source**: The dataset was sourced from an Excel worksheet named "Vitality LifeCare Healthcare Dataset".
- **Data Imported**: Importing the Excel file into Power BI and transforming it in the Power Query Editor for initial cleaning and data processing.

### Data Cleaning
- **Empty Columns**: Removing empty columns.
- **Duplicates and Errors**: Eliminating duplicates and correcting errors.
- **Value Replacement**: Replacing values in columns with proper naming conventions.
- **Data Types**: Detecting and setting the appropriate data types for each column using the auto-detect feature in Power Query Editor.

### Data Processing
- **New Columns**: Creating columns using the conditional column feature in Power Query Editor.
- **KPI Creation**: Used the column to create various KPIs and charts.

### Data Analysis
- **Visualization Tools**: Utilizing bar charts, KPIs, table charts, pie charts, and other visualizations to present data comprehensively.
- **Dashboard Elements**:
  - **Column Chart**: Displaying bed occupancy.
  - **Donut Chart**: Showing feedback volume for doctors.
  - **Funnel Chart**: Displaying diagnosis types.
  - **Line Chart**: Comparing billing amounts with health insurance amounts.

## Key Questions of the Dashboard

- What is the bed occupancy rate?
- How is the feedback volume distributed among doctors?
- What are the common diagnosis types?
- How do billing amounts compare to health insurance amounts?

## Learned About

- **Calculated Fields**: For creating new measures such as billing versus health insurance amount.
- **Matrix Tables**: To show comprehensive data in a tabular format.
- **Visualizations**: Donut charts, pie charts, bar charts, and cluster charts.
- **KPIs and Slicers**: Key Performance Indicators and slicers for filtering data dynamically.
- **Filters**: Used to filter data according to various dimensions such as diagnosis types and doctor feedback.

## Key Insights Summary

- **Bed Occupancy**: Visualized in a column chart to show real-time bed utilization.
- **Doctor Feedback**: A donut chart provides a quick overview of feedback volume for each doctor, aiding in performance evaluation.
- **Diagnosis Types**: A funnel chart helps identify the most common diagnosis, assisting in resource allocation and planning.
- **Financial Overview**: A line chart compares billing amounts to health insurance amounts, providing insights into financial performance and patient insurance coverage.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Power BI**: Ensure Power BI Desktop is installed.
2. **Dataset**: Download the "Vitality LifeCare Healthcare Dataset" Excel file and save it locally.
3. **Import Data**: Open Power BI, import the dataset, and load it into Power Query Editor.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Follow the data cleaning, processing, and analysis steps outlined above to recreate the dashboard.

## Usage

- Open the Power BI file.
- Interact with the various charts and visualizations to explore the data.
- Use slicers and filters to drill down into specific metrics.
